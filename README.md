Jiles-Atherton model library for OCTAVE/MATLAB


The easiest way to start: 
start from the directory 1_isotropic

next you can try 2_anisotropic and 3_mixed for anisotropic and mixed materials respectively

10_APPA, 11_TwoStepSolver and 12_Automation2018 are scripts connected with different papers. Please refer to these papers for details.
