R. Szewczyk "Two step, differential evolution-based identification of parameters of Jiles-Atherton model of magnetic hysteresis loops"
presented during the Automation2018 Conference.

Please note that these scripts are not working with MATLAB
Scripts require differential evolution implementation in de_min() function.
